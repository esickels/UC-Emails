   <p>Dear Eric,</p>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study to determine institutional effectiveness of providing “graduation coaches” in association with IUPUI Home Stretch funding in promoting academic success for IUPUI students. You were selected as a possible subject because you have been offered the opportunity to receive Home Stretch funds and are an IUPUI student that is 18 years of age or older. Your decision to participate in this study will not affect your eligibility to receive financial support through the IUPUI Home Stretch program in any way. The study is designed to assess whether students are more successful when the financial support is paired with academic coaching rather than provided alone.  We plan to use stratified random assignment (randomizing within gender for each school) to determine whether students are offered a “graduation coach” or not. You may be randomly assigned to receive a graduation coach through a simple coin flip.  Advisors within University College will be specially trained to serve as coaches and will not take the place of assigned academic advisors in students’ degree programs. Coaches will make weekly contacts with randomly assigned students through the form of communication (live meeting, telephone, email, text messaging) that is preferred by the student. Coaching will continue throughout the 2013-2014 academic year, ending in May 2014. <strong>Your receipt of support through the Home Stretch fund is in no way impacted by whether you choose to participate in coaching or not.</strong> We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.</p>
 
<p>The study is being conducted by Michele J. Hansen, PhD, Executive Director of Research, Planning, and Evaluation, University College at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) e-mail: <a href="mailto:mjhansen@iupui.edu">mjhansen@iupui.edu</a>.</p>

  <h2>Undergraduate Experiences and Graduation Coach Outcomes Research<br /><br />
 IRB Study #130701185</h2>
<h3>STUDY PURPOSE</h3>
 
<p>The purpose of this study is to determine if graduation coaches paired with financial support positively affect students’ educational success outcomes (graduation, GPAs, credits earned, etc.) more than financial support alone. Our research is designed to assess your experiences as an undergraduate student at IUPUI. We will be creating de-identified datasets containing student level institutional data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, first-generation status, full-time or part-time status, financial aid information, major program, school, GPAs, credit hours accumulated, persistence rates, graduation rates, etc.) and coaching contact information that will be shared with researchers. We will be asking the graduation coaches to keep information about the nature of contacts including the following: mode of communication (e-mail, text, face-to-face, phone), type of information discussed (academic, work, personal, family commitments), who initiated contact, type of information sought, and information about your academic progress. The datasets shared with researchers will not contain any information that can identify you individually.  This study information will help us better understand if providing students with graduation coaches helps to meet students’ diverse needs and facilitate academic success. This study may also contribute to the higher education research literature as we investigate the factors and characteristics that promote student learning and academic success.</p>
<h3>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:</h3>
 
<p>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things:</p>
 
<p>Students assigned to the coaching condition will have the opportunity to participate or not when contacted by the coach. Students who choose not to participate in coaching will still be assessed at the end of the year in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Home Stretch fund. Again, your receipt of support through the Home Stretch fund is in no way impacted by whether you choose to participate in coaching or not. </p>
 
<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
 
<p>Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential.  All data will be secured in a multitier password protected computer environment. We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.  Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.  Your identity will be held in confidence in reports in which the study may be published. Researchers will receive de-identified information from a Data Administrator, who will maintain the key linking coaching contact sheets with university data. In other words, no identifying information will be used by researchers and no identifying information (e.g., name, student ids, emails, addresses) will be shared in any research reports.</p>
 
<p>Organizations that may inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as the study investigator and his/her research associates, the Indiana University Institutional Review Board and (as allowed by law) state or federal agencies, specifically the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), who may need to access your research records.</p>
 
<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
 
<p>There will be no financial payment for participating in this study.</p>
 
<h3>CONTACTS FOR QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS</h3>
 
<p>For questions about the study, contact the researcher Dr. Michele J. Hansen at (317) 278-2618.
For questions about your rights as a research participant or to discuss problems, complaints or concerns about a research study, or to obtain information, or offer input, contact the IU Human Subjects Office at (317) 278-3458 or (800) 696-2949.</p>
 
<h3>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF STUDY</h3>
 
<p>Taking part in this study is voluntary.  You may choose not to take part or may leave the study at any time. Your receipt of support through the Home Stretch fund is in no way impacted by whether you choose to participate in coaching or not. You may also stop participating in graduation coaching at any time during the year. Leaving the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.  Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your current or future relations with Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).</p></blockquote>
